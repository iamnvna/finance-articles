# Non-financial assets

A **non-financial asset** is an asset that cannot be traded on the financial markets and whose value is derived by its physical net worth rather than from a contractual claim, as opposed to a [[financial asset]] (e.g., [[stock]], bonds). Non-financial assets may be tangible (also known as real assets, e.g., land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles) but also intangible (e.g., patents, intellectual property, data).

Non-financial assets can be further divided into **produced assets** (fixed assets, inventories, and valuables) and **non-produced assets** (natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses, and goodwill and marketing assets).

Non-financial assets can be transformed into financial assets through securitization; the non-financing asset thus becomes an [[underlying asset]].
