Nearly 99% of adults agrees that personal finance should become a school subject. Financial authorities offered free educational materials online but only 30% of adults had studied these materials while the other found it difficult and confusing.

In addition, recent research showed that there were no difference between educated and uneducated citizens from a practical point of view.
